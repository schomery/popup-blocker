The "Popup Blocker (strict)" is a lightweight browser extension designed to prevent the opening of popup windows on websites. Unlike other popup blockers, this extension doesn't wait to block popups after they appear; instead, it intercepts and blocks them as soon as they are requested. This extension puts a halt to all requests for new windows, requiring your input to either permit or deny each request. Multiple distinct requests are presented in a list, and if a website makes repeated requests to a specific URL, a badge number will display, indicating the total number of requests for that particular web address.
